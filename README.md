CircuitBirds-Bootstrap
======================
This code is in use at [circuitbirds.com](http://circuitbirds.com). It is hand written and designed completely by students. Mentors only offered advice in certain sections. 

While the site is basic at this time, it will be improved by students, allowing us to learn the basics of web design in a real-world project. 


TODO
======================
  * Add camp page
  * Add Sponsor Detail
  * Dedicated 'about' page with Team roles + student names? + Mentors + Team goals
